# EvolveOS 🧠⚙️

**EvolveOS** is a markdown-first, local-first **Personal Growth Operating System** designed to help you build clear systems for daily planning, journaling, habits, tasks, and long-term growth — without the complexity of tools like Notion.

> Build systems. Grow daily.

## ✨ Why EvolveOS?

Most productivity tools are either:

- too generic
- too complex
- too slow
- too dependent on the cloud

**EvolveOS** takes a different approach:

- 📝 **Markdown-first** — your data stays readable, portable, and future-proof
- ⚡ **Fast & focused** — no block hell, no unnecessary UI
- 🧠 **Opinionated system** — built around proven growth workflows
- 📴 **Offline-first** — your life shouldn’t depend on internet access
- 🔒 **Data ownership** — everything stored locally
